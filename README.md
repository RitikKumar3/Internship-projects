## Introduction
This repository contains hands-on projects that cover a wide range of data science and machine learning concepts. Whether you're a beginner looking to start your journey or an intermediate practitioner seeking practical exercises, you'll find projects that cater to different skill levels.

## Projects
- [Project 1: Capstone Project(Netflix)](project1/)
  - Our objective is to this Project we will be creating one such Recommendation Engine from the ground-up, where every single user, based on there area of interest and ratings, would be recommended a list of movies that are best suited for them.


- [Project 2: Capstone Project(Walmart)](project2/)
  - Objective:- Problem Statement : Capstone Project - Walmart
      A retail store that has multiple outlets across the country are facing issues in managing the inventory - to match the demand with respect to supply. You are 
      a data scientist, who has to come up with useful insights using the data and make prediction models to forecast the sales for X number of months/years.

         - Using the above data, come up with useful insights that can be used by each of the stores to improve in various areas.
         - Forecast the sales for each store for the next 12 weeks.

      
- [Project 3: Capstone Project(Online Retail)](project3/)
  - Objective: - Problem Statement : Capstone Project - OnlineRetail
     An online retail store is trying to understand the various customer purchase patterns for their firm, you are required to give enough evidence based insights 
     to provide the same.

         - Using the data, find useful insights about the customer purchasing history that can be an added advantage for the online retailer.
         - Segment the customers based on their purchasing behavior.
